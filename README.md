# Deiosha S Sparks

*Hello everyone! My name is Deiosha Sparks (she/her), and I am in Seattle, Washington. I am currently transitioning out of the medical field. And I love to travel!!*

A growth mindset, to me, means having the ability to challenge yourself to achieve your goals, especially if you're struggling with self-doubt. A growth mindset is intended to shift your perspective when discussing obstacles and being more optimistic.

My Three Reminders

**The first** reminder I will incorporate to myself to stay in a growth mindset will be to embrace the challenges I would have to encounter and tackle while remembering I can achieve anything I put my mind to. **The second** reminder is to put in the effort, and I must remember that not every task will be easy and that my goals are important. **The third** ~~the fourth~~ reminder is to take constructive criticism because I can learn from everyone I meet.
