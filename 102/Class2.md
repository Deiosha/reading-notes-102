# What is Text Editor?

Text Editor is a program you can install, and the purpose of this program is to assist you in writing and controlling text, for example, what you have written on a website. In the reading, I learned that the key features are code completion, syntax, highlighting, and more.

## Different Text Editors

Notepad++ is specifically for Windows Computers, and it has been utilized for years and is free. It comes with syntax highlight and code completion. This software also comes with help for people who have questions and an excellent research database.  
Bare Bones is also another software that is great for text editing. But it does cost. The text editor that caught my attention was Slim Text because it has a fast database and offers the option to pay or use the free version. It has syntax highlighting and code completion.
I also learned the difference between text editors and IDEs. Text editors are there to help correct text and help organize files, while IDEs has many more features such as debugging and more, plus everything that text editor can provide.
