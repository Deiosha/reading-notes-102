# Topics I Have Learned

Markdown basic syntax is a fantastic tool that can assist you with designing a page. I have discovered how to create a list on GitHub using a hyphen or asterisks. A common mistake I made when styling text was using spaces when applying Asterisks to create italic text, which can cause an error. If spacing out the asterisks when you run your text, the computer will generate what you've written. Another interesting fact I learned is to avoid putting spaces and tabs when writing a paragraph. It's hard to unlearn, but this can cause your style or text to be wonky.
  
  For example:
  ~*Cookies for sell*~ to *Cookies for sell* makes a major difference.
