### Reading Git Intro

*It is possible to see all of the view the short names, such as "origin," When running a git remote command. You can use many controls to help extract data, push, rename, etc. For example, typing in git remote -v assists you in viewing all URLs to the responding shortcut name. When “Fetching” means to extracting data from a remote project. You'll write that by using git fetch [ the-remote-name]*

## My Cheatsheet:

* $ cd example
* $ git remote -v
* git config –global user.name “Jane Smith”
* git config –global user.email “exampl@email.com”
* To confirm that you have the correct settings, enter the following command:
* git config –global user.name (should return Jane Smith)
* git config –global user.email (should return exampl@email.com)
* remote1 “WEBSITE”  (fetch)
* remote1 “WEBSITE”  (push)
* remote2 “WEBSITE”  (fetch)
* remote2 “WEBSITE”  (push)
* remote3“WEBSITE” (fetch)
* remote3 “WEBSITE”  (push)
